# CFetch
A simple system information tool written in C. Works on Linux only.

### Build from source: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ayannw/cfetch.git
cd cfetch
gcc src/main.c -o cfetch
./cfetch 
```

### ASCII Arts
For now, the only way to change the ASCII art is editing the code and recompiling.
